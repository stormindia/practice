# Problem 2 solution(Python 3):
# You are given a CSV file employees.csv as shown below. In this file,  the managerid column refers to the id of the employee who is a manager. So, the manager is also an employee. For example Ramesh is the manager of Dinesh in the CSV file given below.
#
# employees.csv
#
# Id, name, managerid
# 1, Dinesh, 2
# 2, Ramesh, 4
# 3, Sandeep, 4
# 4, Abhishek, NULL
#
# You have to read this csv file and create a tree like structure in which parent node is the manager of the child node. You can use “\t” tab for indentation or showing the hierarchy.
#
# Output for the above file -
#
# Abhishek - 4
# 	Ramesh - 2
# 		Dinesh - 1
# 	Sandeep - 3
#
# Please comment your code properly so that we can understand your approach.

#This code also works for the case where there are more than 1 managers who don't have report to anyone
#So in addition to above mentioned inputs, below inputs also work -
#Input
# Id, name, managerid
# 1, Dinesh,	2
# 2, Ramesh,	4
# 3, Sandeep,	4
# 4, Abhishek,	 NULL
# 5,  Abhek,	 NULL

#Output
# Abhishek - 4
# 	Ramesh - 2
# 		Dinesh - 1
# 	Sandeep - 3
# Abhek - 4


#below code will also work if an employee has more than 1 manager
#however, we need to assume that the manager's row number in the CSV must be same as that of ID as displayed in the sample inputs (!important)
#otherwise we would need to perform a search in the entire data
#Input
# Id, name, managerid
# 1, Dinesh,	2
# 2, Ramesh,	4
# 3, Sandeep,	4
# 4, Abhishek,	 NULL
# 5, Abhek,	 NULL
#6, asdasd, NULL
# 1, Dinesh,	6
# 3, Sandeep,	5

#Output
# Abhishek - 4
# 	Ramesh - 2
# 		Dinesh - 1
# 	Sandeep - 3
# Abhek - 4
# 	Sandeep - 3
# asdasd - 6
#   Dinesh - 1
